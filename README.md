Project: E-commerce Microservices Architecture
Overview
This project will be a fully functional E-commerce application where users can browse products, add them to a cart, place orders, process payments, and track deliveries. Each functionality is handled by an independent microservice communicating via event-driven architecture.

Microservices and Their Responsibilities
Microservice	Responsibilities
API Gateway	Entry point for all requests, routing, authentication, and rate limiting.
User Service	Manages user registration, login, authentication, and authorization.
Product Service	Manages products, categories, and inventory.
Cart Service	Handles user carts, adding/removing products, and updating quantities.
Order Service	Manages order placement, tracking, and history.
Payment Service	Processes payments using third-party providers (e.g., Stripe, Razorpay, PayPal).
Shipping Service	Handles order shipment, tracking, and delivery notifications.
Notification Service	Sends emails, SMS, and push notifications for order updates.
Review & Rating Service	Manages customer reviews and product ratings.
Admin Service	Provides an admin dashboard for managing users, products, orders, etc.
Analytics Service	Tracks sales, user behavior, and generates reports.
Technologies and Tools Used
Spring Boot (For developing all microservices)
Spring Cloud Gateway (For API Gateway)
Spring Security & JWT (For authentication & authorization)
Eureka Server (Netflix Eureka) (For service discovery)
Feign Client & RestTemplate (For service-to-service communication)
RabbitMQ / Apache Kafka (For event-driven communication)
MySQL / PostgreSQL / MongoDB (For databases)
Redis (For caching frequently accessed data)
ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) / Prometheus & Grafana (For logging, monitoring, and observability)
Docker & Kubernetes (For containerization and orchestration)
CI/CD using Jenkins / GitHub Actions (For automated deployment)
Microservices Concepts Covered
âœ… API Gateway - Centralized routing and authentication
âœ… Service Discovery - Registering and discovering services dynamically
âœ… Load Balancing - Using Ribbon or Kubernetes Load Balancer
âœ… Event-Driven Architecture - Using Kafka/RabbitMQ for async communication
âœ… Distributed Logging & Monitoring - ELK Stack, Prometheus & Grafana
âœ… Database Per Service - Using different databases for different services
âœ… Circuit Breaker & Resilience - Using Resilience4j or Hystrix for fault tolerance
âœ… Caching - Implementing Redis for performance optimization
âœ… Containerization & Deployment - Using Docker & Kubernetes

Additional Enhancements
Rate Limiting & Throttling (To prevent DDoS attacks)
Distributed Transactions (Using SAGA pattern with Kafka)
Automated Testing (Using JUnit, Testcontainers, and WireMock for API testing)
GraphQL API (For efficient data fetching)
Architecture Diagram
ðŸ“Œ Request Flow Example:

A user logs in via API Gateway, which routes the request to the User Service.
The user browses products from the Product Service.
Adds items to the cart via Cart Service.
Places an order, triggering an event in Order Service.
Payment Service processes the payment.
Shipping Service handles delivery.
Notification Service sends updates via email/SMS.
Why This Project?
âœ” Real-world use case covering almost all microservices concepts.
âœ” Scalable - Can handle millions of users by adding more instances.
âœ” Modular - Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
âœ” Perfect for learning & portfolio - Demonstrates expertise in microservices.
